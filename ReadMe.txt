README for OpenSourceTEBD_v2.0
Author:  M. L. Wall
Date:  9.28.09

SUMMARY:
This README is contained in the main directory of OpenSourceTEBD_v1.0.  The other items in this directory are the GNU public license (gpl.txt) under which this package is distributed, the "Core" Directories which contain the procedures making up the code, and the directory Case_Studies, which contains other subdirectories leading to the Case Studies discussed in the User's guide.  If you are wondering where to start, I would head into one of the Case studies subdirectories and read the README there, it will tell you how to compile the case studies.

If you wish to know more about the package, consult the User's guide.
