README for Fermi_Wrapper
Author:  M. L. Wall
Date:  9.28.09


SUMMARY:
This wrapper contains main programs that demonstrate how to use the Open Source TEBD software in the context of a spinless fermi gas.

COMPILATION DIRECTIONS:
A makefile is included.  The primary rules are:
1. 'make ITP'
This command will compile the main program FermionITP.f90, which computes ground state properties of the Bose Hubbard model.  The associated executable is Execute_ITP.  The data is stored in the directory 'ITPDATA'.

2. 'make clean'
This command will remove all .mod and .o files.

3. 'make touch'
This command will force recompilation of all objects at the next make command.

RUNNING CODE:
To run the executable 'Execute_*', type './Execute_*'.
