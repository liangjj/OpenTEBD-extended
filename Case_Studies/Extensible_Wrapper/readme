README for Heisenberg_Wrapper
Author:  M. L. Wall
Date:  9.28.09


SUMMARY:
This wrapper contains main programs that demonstrate how to use the Open Source TEBD software in the context of the Heisenberg spin chain.

COMPILATION DIRECTIONS:
A makefile is included.  The primary rules are:
1. 'make XX'
This command will compile the main program XXDynamics.f90, which time evolves an initial state with one domain wall according to the XX Hamiltonian.  The associated executable is Execute_XX.  The data is stored in the directory 'RTPDATA'.

2. 'make clean'
This command will remove all .mod and .o files.

3. 'make touch'
This command will force recompilation of all objects at the next make command.

RUNNING CODE:
To run the executable 'Execute_*', type './Execute_*'.
